\maketitle


\begin{itemize}
    \item Now after organizing most of the content I still have confusion regarding the style.
    \item I'm not sure yet if I need to include a table for the analysis part. 
    \item Most of the papers I reviewed had table that list their results of analysis.
    \item In the discussion part, I think it would be better to briefly illustrate the other attacks  that related to the IFA.
    \item I'm not sure if I should include the current literature in the same section of the discussion or should I make them two different sections. 
    \item You can download this file from github from the below link: \url{https://github.com/BoultClasses/CS6000-Abumouzah/tree/master/Journal%207}
